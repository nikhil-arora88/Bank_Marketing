In this project, we will study a publicly available data set from UCI’s Machine Learning repository (source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)to understand the factors that can help determine consumers’ probability of positive response to a Fixed Deposit (FD) marketing campaign. The data is from a campaign run by a Portuguese bank on getting new FDs from existing customers. It has various features on each customer along with a decision variable which indicates where he/she decided to place a FD during the campaign (a positive response).
